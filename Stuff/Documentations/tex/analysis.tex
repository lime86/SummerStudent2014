analysis

Atom analysis, run it on background and data files, outputs root histograms in .root format and the same histograms as pdf file.

for batch, use runAnalysis.sh, need access to /atlas/data3/userdata/lmeng/MCFiles though

then run it through readtree.cc, using getCuts.sh, outputs a cuts.txt in Statistics directory and in each analysis directory a Atom.signal

Format cuts.txt

Filename SR Integral Error

Then use the statistics scripts to read cuts.txt

\lstinline|python mergebkg.py|

Outputs bkgobs.txt with

bla SR Nbkg errNbkg1 errNbkg2 errNbkg3 Nobs 95\%Obs

where 95\%Obs is calculated by cls.py

Then try 


\lstinline|python generatePlot.py folder|

to generate plot using Atom.signal and bkgobs.txt. The folder name must contain the CMS energy.
