madgraph stuff

How to install:



How to generate stuff:

Unzip the model found in the note "Simplified model FeynRules" in the models/ directory 

Import the model

mg5>import model dmV_UFO

Generate your process (careful with spaces)
mg5>generate p p > g xi, xi > chi chi~  --> not working
mg5>generate p p > g chi chi~  --> not working

[If you want to decide how many orders you want for the calculation use the following, only if it's inside the model though

mg5>generate p p > g xi, xi > g chi chi QED=99 QCD=99 @2 ]

Set the output directory naming - you'll find

mg5>output dm_mediator_g_monojet

Start the production

mg5>launch

Tell it you want to shower with Pythia when asked by typing "1"

mg5>1

Change the parameter card by typing 1: CM energy, PDF and Madgraph-level cuts (set qCut=80)
Change the run card by typing 2: mass of the chi (1 TeV for now)
Can also change with Pythia6

mg5>done
