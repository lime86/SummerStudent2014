ssh into lxplus with your username: (alternatively lxplus5 or lxplus6 for SLC5 or SLC6 respectively).

\lstinline|ssh lmeng@lxplus.cern.ch -Y|

copy the following script to your home directory (only once)

\lstinline|cp ~/doglioni/public/.bashrc .|

and then source it everytime you log in

\lstinline|source ~/.bashrc|

this gives you a few useful commands, including all the ATLAS software framework setup. To set up ROOT you have to do:

\lstinline|setupATLAS|

and then to set up ROOT:

\lstinline|localSetupROOT|
