There is the batch system you can use simply if you log onto lxplus. View queues you have access to:

\lstinline|bqueues -u username|

The queues are as following (with the normalised CPU time)

8nm (8 minutes)
1nh (1 hour)
8nh
1nd (1day)
2nd
1nw (1 week)
2nw

The run time limit is in average 4 times shorter than in real life
